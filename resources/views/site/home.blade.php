          <h2 class="heading2">The Howling Wolves</h2>
          <p>My family and friends forced me away as they quickly learned. I was not quite human anymore.</p>
          <p> It took about three weeks for laycaon to find me, sleeping on the streets, and introduce me to my new family, Lycaon had seeked me out for reasons I still don't understand. The howling Wolves were relatively small in population, only around 7,000 walked the earth, but they were mighty in the impact they had on the world.</p>
          <p>
          There is a distinct hierarchy in the Howling Wolves. Lycaon is our leader, the first of our kind, the Omega. His first disciples became the ruling class of the Howling Wolves. They’re known as the Alphas, Betas and Redwolves. Most of the ruling class began their lives in ancient times, during the beginning of modern civilization.</p>
          <div class="content_readmore">
            <p>The early days of the Howling Wolves caused there to be hundreds of thousands running around causing havoc. Over the years the population has died out due to war and internal strife.</p>
            <p>
              You can tell us apart by our unique characteristics. We all have different clothing, faces, eyes and body types. Different ranks of Howling Wolves live in contrasting homes and environments, we boast different treasures and trinkets.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ruling class wears clothing fitting to their rank - extravagant outfits, brightly colored hats and gloves made of exotic materials. They also like to carry around symbols of their status like scepters, jewels and famous works of art. These high level Howling Wolves prefer to spend their time in exclusive vacation spots, famous museums and unforgettable landmarks.
            </p>
            <p>Some of the more common Howling Wolves tend to wear common clothing like suits and ties or regular streetwear that you see in any city nowadays.</p>
